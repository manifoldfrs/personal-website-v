## Thoughts on Spartan Society

In history, few civilizations have left as indelible a mark as the Spartans of ancient Greece. Renowned for their warrior culture, discipline, and unwavering commitment to their city-state, Sparta has long captured the imagination of historians, filmmakers, and enthusiasts of the past. Yet, beneath the surface of their martial reputation lies a society that defied the norms of its time in fascinating ways. Lets explore their no-nonsense ethos of discipline and unity and ponder what these ancient champions might look like today if armed with more technology.

### Discipline: The Spartan Way of Life

Discipline formed the bedrock of Spartan society, rooted in the culture and practices that defined this ancient Greek city-state. Historically, this ethos was evident from the earliest stages of life. According to Plutarch's "Life of Lycurgus," Spartan infants underwent a meticulous examination to determine their fitness for citizenship, an unparalleled practice in ancient Greece. Those deemed weak or unhealthy were often abandoned, while only the robust were granted the privilege of becoming Spartan citizens.

The commitment to discipline extended beyond infancy. The famed Spartan institution known as the "agoge" was the cornerstone of their educational system. This intensive training regimen, described by Xenophon in his work "Constitution of the Lacedaemonians," started at the tender age of seven and continued through adolescence. It encompassed not just martial training but also instilled core values like self-control, sacrifice, and the paramount importance of the collective over the individual.

On the battlefield, Spartan discipline was perhaps most evident in the prowess of their hoplites. Spartan hoplites were renowned for their unyielding discipline and fearlessness in combat. Historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his book "The Western Way of War," highlights the effectiveness of the Spartan phalanx formation, where soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder, forming an impenetrable wall of shields and spears. Retreat was a rarely entertained option for Spartan hoplites, even when facing overwhelming odds, as detailed by Thucydides in his "History of the Peloponnesian War." It was this indomitable discipline that elevated them to legendary status on the battlefield, striking terror into the hearts of their adversaries.

### Unity: The Spartan Bond of Strength

In the mosaic of ancient Greek city-states, Sparta stood as a masterpiece of unity and cohesion. This sense of unity, often referred to as "homonoia," was a testament to the intrinsic bond among its citizens, one forged not through sweeping ideologies but through shared experiences and collective purpose.

At the heart of Spartan unity was a profound dedication to the collective good over individual interests. This commitment was exemplified in the unique Spartan land redistribution system, often attributed to their legendary lawgiver, Lycurgus. Unlike many other Greek city-states, where economic disparities grew with individual ambitions, Spartans valued a relative economic equality among their citizenry. Yet, this wasn't an exercise in ideological equality but a practical measure, reflecting their belief that each Spartan should earn their keep through strength and dedication.

This Spartan unity was woven into the very fabric of their society through their military training. The rigorous agoge, as detailed by Xenophon, wasn't just about physical fitness and combat skills; it was a crucible that forged unbreakable bonds among young Spartans. These future warriors underwent the same arduous trials, shared the same hardships, and developed an unwavering trust in one another. It was their collective dedication to strength and discipline that fortified their unity.

Spartan unity also found expression in their political stability, as outlined by Aristotle in his "Politics." Their dual kingship system and the council of elders known as the Gerousia provided a remarkably stable governance structure. This unity and stability enabled Sparta to project an unwavering front to the outside world, making them a formidable Greek state.

In a Greece marked by the disunity of its city-states, Spartan unity shone as a beacon of strength, reminding us that it's not grand ideologies but shared commitment and a focus on collective strength that can bind a society together.

### Spartan Society and the Ambivalence Towards Technology

In the annals of history, the Spartans are renowned for their disciplined, militaristic way of life. But when it comes to technology, their approach was unique and somewhat ambivalent. Spartan society, in its pursuit of martial excellence and unity, had a distinct relationship with technology, one that set them apart from their contemporaries in ancient Greece.

**Minimalism Over Innovation**: Spartan culture prioritized simplicity and minimalism. Unlike other Greek city-states, where technological innovation was celebrated and sought after, the Spartans viewed technological advancement with caution. They believed that excessive reliance on technology could lead to complacency, potentially weakening their warrior ethos.

Historical accounts, such as Plutarch's "Life of Lycurgus," emphasize Spartan society's emphasis on discipline and austerity. This was reflected in their approach to technology.

**Weapons and Tools**: Spartans certainly used weapons and tools, but they valued functionality over complexity. Their weapons, such as the iconic spear and round shield, were straightforward and effective. This pragmatic approach reflected their focus on military utility rather than technological novelty.

Scholars like Victor Davis Hanson, in his work "The Western Way of War," have highlighted the practical nature of Spartan arms and armor.

**The Role of the Helots**: One reason for the Spartan ambivalence towards technology was their reliance on the labor of the Helots, a subjugated class that farmed and produced goods. While other Greek city-states might have embraced technological innovations to enhance productivity, the Spartans, secure in their military training, saw little need to do so themselves.

This aspect is discussed in various historical accounts of Spartan society, including Xenophon's "Constitution of the Lacedaemonians."

**Embracing What Works**: While they were cautious about adopting new technologies, the Spartans were not entirely averse to practical tools. They would adopt or adapt technologies if they saw clear benefits, such as improved armor or tactics that complemented their style of warfare.

Historical records and accounts, such as Herodotus' "Histories," mention instances where Spartans made use of effective technologies when necessary.

**The Spartan Ethos Prevails**: Ultimately, Spartan society's ethos of discipline, unity, and martial prowess was the guiding principle. Technology was accepted only insofar as it served these core values. Spartan warriors were expected to excel through their own physical and mental strength, not through reliance on gadgets or machines.

In a world where technological advancement was rapidly reshaping the landscape of ancient Greece, Sparta's unique perspective on technology serves as a reminder of their unwavering commitment to their distinctive way of life.

### Modern Spartan Society: A Harmonious Fusion of Discipline and Free Markets

Imagine a modern society where the echoes of ancient Sparta's discipline and unity reverberate, but where individual freedoms and free markets are held in high regard. In this hypothetical world, the Spartan ethos of strength, resilience, and dedication coexists with the recognition that personal liberty and innovation are not only valued but celebrated.

**Discipline Redefined**: In this modern Sparta, discipline takes on new forms. While there's still a commitment to self-control and dedication, it extends beyond the physical realm. Citizens are encouraged to master their talents, whether in technology, the arts, or sciences. The rigorous education system, inspired by the Spartan agoge, fosters not just physical fitness but also intellectual prowess.

Technology and Spartan Values: Spartan-inspired technology isn't shunned but embraced judiciously. The focus remains on practicality and functionality, ensuring that technology serves the free markets. Innovations in fields like renewable energy, healthcare, and sustainable agriculture flourish, reinforcing the Spartan commitment to free-market-driven progress.

**Unity and Individualism**: In this modern Sparta, unity is still a cornerstone, but it coexists harmoniously with individualism. Citizens recognize that collective strength is bolstered when individuals are free to pursue their passions and ideas in the free markets. A strong social safety net ensures that everyone has access to education and healthcare, fostering a society where personal success and free-market-driven communal welfare go hand in hand.

**Martial Excellence and Diplomacy**: The martial traditions of ancient Sparta find a new expression in modern times. Highly trained defense forces protect the society, but diplomacy and conflict resolution are equally valued skills in the free-market-driven global stage. Spartans of this era are not just warriors but also diplomats, scholars, and innovators in the free markets.

**Cultural Identity and Freedom**: In this modern Sparta, citizens celebrate their distinctive culture and values while respecting diverse perspectives. Individual freedoms in the free markets are safeguarded, allowing for a rich tapestry of thought and expression. The Spartan spirit of resilience and determination fuels not just military endeavors but also entrepreneurial ventures, artistic creations, and scientific discoveries.

**Global Engagement**: Modern Sparta actively engages with the global community, participating in international organizations and free-market-driven diplomacy. Their unique blend of discipline, unity, and individual freedom serves as a model for addressing global challenges, from climate change to free-market-driven conflict resolution.

In this vision of a modern Spartan society, the lessons of discipline and unity from ancient Sparta are not in conflict with individual freedom and the dynamism of free markets. Instead, they are integrated into a dynamic and harmonious society that thrives in the technologically advanced world of today. This fusion of values creates a society where strength and resilience coexist with personal liberty and free-market-driven progress.
