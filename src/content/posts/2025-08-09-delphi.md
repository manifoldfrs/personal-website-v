> I remembered you once before, so I remembered you again.

## What's the most you've ever suffered?

If I look back on my life, I can recall that the moments of my biggest growth were always after moments of experiencing immense pain, the pain of realizing the world is not as you want it to be. Moments of true suffering are [Black swan events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory). If you make it out alive, you live to tell a better story.

Speaking of stories, I've joined a new startup called [Delphi](https://delphi.ai).

## Why Delphi

I’ve always learned best from people. Books, audio, and videos are great, but often they tend to drift into broadcast. Real progress comes from those that meet you where you are. A conversation that makes you smile, makes you feel something singular. A story that evokes joy, anger, sadness, and all the shades in between. This is what we're making at Delphi. Minds that are personal, adaptive, and always available. A digital Library of Alexandria.

I like that ambition. I also like that the team cares more about fidelity than theater. Human intelligence at scale only works if the experience feels authentic. And it's not just about the living, imagine speaking to the dead as well. A conversation with Lazarus after the cave, or with a loved one once more. My role there is more than just coding. It's to sit with our customers and their problems until the shape of the fix becomes obvious. This is where I’m happiest: close to users, close to code, and close to the truth; proximity to pain wins. Stay close to the real use long enough and the right abstractions reveal themselves.

The bet we're making is that individual stories beat generic ones. That guidance works best when it doesn't reflect a bland average and isn't watered down to be performative. Agency can scale: not by outsourcing judgment, but by distilling and extending it, so a person’s hard‑won suffering and stories can travel further. The next decade of AI startups belongs to teams who can orchestrate reasoning systems into dependable workflows with robust guardrails, observability, and tight feedback loops.

If we do this right, Delphis accurately represent people and carry their judgment into the moments when it’s needed the most. When others are alone, when they're lost, when they're afraid. Imagine if you could speak to your great grandfather, your favorite philosopher, or a friend you lost. Delphis aren't a replacement for people; they're a force multiplier for their best ideas. This won't be easy, startups generally aren't, and what we aim to do is define a category that's never existed. Which is why we're putting together a team of relentless builders. Dreams are cheap, but results are not. If this sounds like your kind of problem, [we’re looking for engineers who like owning outcomes](https://delphi.ai/careers#roles).

Imagine being able to leave something living behind—a version of yourself your loved ones can talk to long after you're gone. After all, you live as long as the last person who remembers you.
